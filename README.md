Neural Networks Vs Time Series
============

This repository has a misleading name - while this project original set out to show the difference between time series and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in predictive power, I ultimately decided for simplicity to use just a standard feed foward neural network.


Data
====

Data was provided to me is timestamps of logins for a website. It is preprocessed to be hourly data but has a unit root, so the time series component will be at a minimum (0,1,0) where the 1 is a unit root integration.


Findings
======

TBD
